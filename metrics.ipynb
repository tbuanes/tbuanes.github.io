If this metric is used in the maintenance example from the [utility section](lossMetricUtility.ipynb#sec-utility), the result would be very bad indeed. Since the metric prioritises a high purity among the instances classified as positive, but does not pay any regard to the instances classified as negative, a large false negative rate is likely. But this was exactly what needed to be avoided in this case, since a false negative would lead to a breakdown of the machinery and thus incur a large cost.\n",

If we use *accuracy* as our metric we would probably end up with a model that classifies all instances as negative, since this model would be 99.9% accurate. However, despite of the very high accuracy, the model is completely useless since none of the interesting instances are found."
